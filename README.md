# go-wrk 0.1
go-wrk [flags] url
go-wrk -t=8 -c=100 -n=10000 "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/book"

-H="User-Agent: go-wrk 0.1 bechmark\nContent-Type: text/html;": 由'\n'分隔的请求头
-c=100: 使用的最大连接数
-k=true: 是否禁用keep-alives
-i=false: if TLS security checks are disabled
-m="GET": HTTP请求方法
-n=1000: 请求总数
-t=1: 使用的线程数
-b="" HTTP请求体
-s="" 如果指定，它将计算响应中包含搜索到的字符串s的频率

this is a small http benchmark utility similar to https://github.com/wg/wrk but written in go.
it has a couple of features absent from wrk
 
  - https support (quite expensive on the client side with disabled keep alives)
  - http POST support
  - more statistics
  - leaner codebase

## status

this tool is in early stage development but stable enough to run larger benchmark sets.
missing features will be added as needed, pull requests are welcome ;)

## building

you need go 1.0+ (1.1 is suggested for performance)

```
git clone git://github.com/adeven/go-wrk.git
cd go-wrk
go build
```

## usage

basic usage is quite simple:
```
go-wrk [flags] url
```

with the flags being
```
    -H="User-Agent: go-wrk 0.1 bechmark\nContent-Type: text/html;": the http headers sent separated by '\n'
    -c=100: the max numbers of connections used
    -k=true: if keep-alives are disabled
    -i=false: if TLS security checks are disabled
    -m="GET": the http request method
    -n=1000: the total number of calls processed
    -t=1: the numbers of threads used
    -b="" the http request body
    -s="" if specified, it counts how often the searched string s is contained in the responses
```
for example
```
go-wrk -c=400 -t=8 -n=100000 http://localhost:8080/index.html
```


## example output
